How Git works
Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
"Push" your changes to your master branch
Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
"Pull" the changes to your local machine
Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the master branch)
"Merge" your branch to the master branch
